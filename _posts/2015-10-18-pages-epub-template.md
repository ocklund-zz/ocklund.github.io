## Pages ePub template

As I was telling you in one of my previous posts ([Self Publish E-book](/2015/06/12/self-publish-e-book.html)), I prefer the Apple software Pages for creating e-books with flowing text. I thought it odd, however, that Pages, which can export to the ePub format, didn't come with a decent ePub template. Apple just kept referring to a pretty lame ["best practices" template](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202066), which I found unusable, even though it looked quite basic. Instead I started from scratch with my own template to get a simple layout that was easy to work with.

Pages was updated to version 5.6 in the beginning of October 2015. Now they've finally included a ePub template. It looks fairly simple and it even contains better instructions how you should use it compared to the "best practices" template. I might base my template for the upcoming book on it. Let's see if it holds water.

Remember, though, that some distributors of e-books, like e. g. libraries in Sweden, still don't support version 3 of ePub, only version 2. Since Pages for the moment doesn't support version 2, you'll have to choose your tools carefully.
