My novel "Shivas tredje Ã¶ga" ("Shiva's Third Eye") is now available as e-book in iTunes and Google Play (in Swedish). I wrote it in 2012, but I didn't publish the novel until now as an experiment to see how difficult it was to publish an e-book by yourself. Turned out it was both easier and harder than imagined, which I will tell you more about in a future post.

My idea with this novel from the beginning was to write a book I myself would like to read - a short, straight story where dialog and events drive the story forward, rather than long descriptions of characters, places and courses of events. This means also that I try to give the reader a chance to create her own image of the characters. Some readers are probably not used to this, but for me it's a relief not being told in detail what to think.

The novel is yet to be translated, but here's a short description what it is about.

### About "Shiva's Third Eye"

In Stockholm, a man falls down dead in the middle of the street with an icicle buried deep in his eye socket. This is the first of a series of horrific accidents occurring within a few days in the Swedish capital, seemingly without any connection.

At home, the slacker and programmer Ali Olsson, is relaxing with his friends Magnus Lindmann, a psychology researcher, and Diana Eyal, with a shady background in Israel. While they all are enjoying pizza and beer in the sofa, Ali pulls up his laptop to show Diana, Magnus and his latest creation: a system capable of gathering and analyzing video streams from any Internet connected camera in the world.

While randomly browsing the video streams, they accidentally witness a brutal murder. Through the camera of the victim's computer they also see how the murderer covers his tracks, making it look like an accident. How many of the accidents the last couple of days in Stockholm is really the work of this professional killer?

Soon the hired killer realizes someone is onto him. At the same time, Ali's and Magnus' system is getting smarter and starting to take own initiatives, which gains attention in the intelligence community. A race is on between the intelligence organizations of the world to get hold of the system and win the ongoing secret cyberwar.

Diana, Magnus and Ali find themselves in the eye of the storm. Professional killers, intelligence agents and special operatives are determined to hunt them down. And the three of them have only each other to rely on.

"Shiva's Third Eye" is a fast-paced thriller with hi-tech elements. It takes place in a reality we recognize, but lifts the curtain to reveal the shadow land, where the few controls how the many live - and die.
