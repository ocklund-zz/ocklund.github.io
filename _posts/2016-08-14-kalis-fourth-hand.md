My new novel "Kalis fjärde hand" (Kali's Fourth Hand) is now available in Swedish as an e-book at [iTunes (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/se/book/kalis-fjarde-hand/id1142386125?mt=11) and at [Google Play (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Kenneth_Ocklund_Kalis_fj%C3%A4rde_hand?id=JaTSDAAAQBAJ). It's a follow-up of my action packed novel ["Shivas tredje öga" (Shiva's Third Eye)](/2015/04/26/shivas-third-eye.html) which was published in 2015. Our friends Diana, Ali and Magnus, who had it rough in the last book, are now facing even greater odds this time. Without giving away to much, this is the story in short:

The hacker Ali Olsson and his friend, the psychology scientist Magnus Lindmann, are relaxing on a surf beach at the Pacific Ocean coast in Nicaragua. They're laying low after having escaped a hitman and outfox half of the intelligence community in the world, who tried to take control over their revolutionary global surveillance system. In great part they owe it to their friend Diana Eyal, who turned out to have a dark past as a Mossad field operative (see "Shiva's Third Eye"). But Ali grows restless and soon introduces Magnus to his latest idea: to manipulate the high frequency stock trade at the stock exchange in the USA and make a lot of money, without being detected. However, on the way to New York, they're kidnapped by a Mexican cartel. They find themselves in the middle of a cartel war with connections all the way up to the highest levels of those in power in the world. The trio must fight for their lives, hunted by Mexican killers and American mercenaries. But they are determined to go through with their greatest heist so far, anyway.
