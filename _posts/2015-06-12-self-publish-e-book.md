Not to long ago I published my novel [“Shivas tredje öga”](https://itunes.apple.com/se/book/shivas-tredje-oga/id989530003?mt=11&at=&ct=SV_se&ign-mpt=uo%3D6) ("Shiva's Third Eye") as e-book. This is a short summary how I did this. Hopefully it may help someone about to jump down the same rabbit hole. It's mostly about publishing an ordinary e-book with flowing text, not a photo book or something with an advanced layout.

But remember: I'm not saying that this is the right way. I don't know if self publishing is for you or how to get a lot of readers. OK? Let's get to it.

### Step 1 - Write the book
Don't even start thinking about publishing before you have written the book. If you have to change while creating the e-book, always change the original text and then insert the changes in the e-book. Otherwise it's difficult to keep track of versions if something happens to the e-book files. It helps a lot if your text is completely unformatted, without page breaks or even line breaks (perhaps only for new paragraphs). You'll have to adjust the text format in the e-book tool anyway. Seriously, stop reading now and finish your book, if you haven't done that already.

### Step 2 - Create the cover
I'm not a master in marketing, but I believe it pays off going that extra mile with the book cover. In most cases it's the only way of communicating with a potential reader in the e-book listings where you publish your e-book. I'm not a master in design either, so I started a design competition at [99designs.com](http://99designs.com/), which worked out better than I expected. I was able to choose between a lot of design proposals and then go on refining the proposals I liked the most. If you go down the same path, make sure to be clear from the beginning what you want and give lots of feedback on proposals to steer the process right. For most e-book publishers you only need a front page, not a complete book cover (front/side/back). Unless of course you'd want to publish your work as a physical book also.

### Step 3 - Get the ISBN
Most publishers, even for e-books, will ask you for an [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) for your book. This is usually provided by the traditional book publisher, but if you are a self publisher you have to roll your own. If you're lucky and live in Sweden - like I do - you just ask the Royal Library for an ISBN for free. But you poor so-and-so's elsewhere have to buy them. There are services all over the Internet for that.

### Step 4 - Choose your tool
If you want to reach as many e-book readers as possible on as many devices as possible, I'd say [ePub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) is the standard you should use. An exception is Amazon Kindle that uses it's own format. If you want your e-book on Kindle, I don't have any advice, I'm afraid. The ePub format is suitable for e-books with flowing text and adapts to different screen sizes. Apple encourages e-book creators to use their tool iBook Author. However, it doesn't currently support ePub and is more suitable for creating rich content e-books with lots of images and other media. Instead I chose the Apple tool Pages that can export documents to ePub format. Be aware though, that Pages only support the latest version 3 of ePub. It's the best version for publishing at iTunes or Google Play, but it's not supported in digital libraries in Sweden that only supports version 2. For that I had to find another tool and found the e-book tool [Jutoh](http://www.jutoh.com/). It has a terribly busy UI and a lot of settings that don't make sense, but at least it supports ePub 2. If you need only the latest version of ePub, I'd recommend Pages or another more modern e-book tool that's easier to work with.

### Create the e-book
I would recommend to keep it simple in the beginning. The more advanced layout you use, the more you'll find that it doesn't work on all devices. There are templates for e-books, but I discovered that I had to put a lot of effort into adapting them to my liking. I started from scratch instead. Simply put, this is how I created the e-book:

1 - Put you new shiny cover image on the first page

2 - Add a page break for the copyright page and add &copy; text

3 - Add a page break for the first chapter

4 - Add the flowing text for the chapter

5 - Add a page break for the next chapter

6 - Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you're done

Now you may go through your e-book a billion times and make sure that the text flows as it should. Every e-book out there has it's own style regarding new paragraph, indentation and dialog. Check up on e-books that you like and see how they've formatted the text. When you're done formatting, export the result to an ePub file. Upload your e-book to as many devices you can and take notes what to change. Make the changes in your e-book tool and verify again on target devices. Repeat until done. 

### Step 6 - Publish the e-book
Before we go any further I'd like to ask you one question: Are you ready to assume all the responsability to make sure your e-book sells and gets read? You'll have no publisher doing the job, and no one to blame when only your mom buys your e-book. OK, I just wanted to check. Let's continue. When your ePub file is ready, it's fairly easy to publish it. To make it available on iOS/Mac you may publish it at [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/working-itunes/sell-content/) and for Android devices there's [Google Play](https://play.google.com/books/publish/u/0/). There are also services that publish to all kinds of e-book markets, including libraries. I have only used one for the Swedish market [Elib](http://www2.elib.se/), so I won't get into that in detail. Most e-book publishers lets you keep the rights of your book, which is what you want. They take a cut of the sales of your e-book, mostly around 10-30%. Check the publisher's percentage before you decide. I chose iTunes and Google Play because I wanted to handle the publishing myself for those markets. There's no definitive answer to at which price you should sell your e-book. Some publishers set a low price to fight their way in to the top seller lists and then increase the price. I just tried to find e-books comparable to mine and set the price accordingly.

Special note to Swedish self publishers: [Send a copy](http://www.kb.se/plikt/eplikt/) of your e-book to the Royal Library so that it's preserved in their archives forever. Forever-ever? Forever-ever-ever!

### Step 7 - Market your e-book
Now it's all up to you. If nobody knows about your e-book, no one will buy it. Unfortunately, I have no advice to give you in this regard. Each author and book has it's own way to find it's audience. They say social media is worth considering to get the message out ;) All services where you can publish your e-book has reporting tools so that you may follow the sales of your e-book and act on that in your marketing.

### Some reflections
OK, so what did I learn when self-publishing my e-book? Here are som thoughts:

**If no traditional** book publisher is interested in your script, there's always the possibility to publish it as an e-book yourself for almost no cost at all

**Most e-book** publishing services let you keep the rights to your work

**It's very difficult** for a self publisher to match to marketing resources of the traditional book publishers. I think they will go the same way the record companies did and become gigantic marketing machines only, in the future

**It was easier** to create and publish an e-book than I thought. Also, compared to publishing a book with the traditional book publishers (we're talking years), it's lightning fast

**I have yet to hear** about an author that started out as self publisher and became a top seller. It's probably just a question of time. Maybe that's going to be you?

### The e-book
Well, what's this e-book that I published myself? Here it is:
